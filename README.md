Project 1 for Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico course Algorithms for Computational Logic 2024.

Version of Traveling Salesman Problem, Flying Tourist Problem, solved with Python, pySAT library
and MaxSAT-logic.

More information about the project can be found from the project statement by Vasco Manquinho (Senior Lecturer) and from the project report.

Following instructions created and provided by Vasco Manquinho (Senior Lecturer):


- Running your project locally:


```
python3 project1.py < test1.ttp > test1.myout 
```


- To run the other scripts in the git repository, you need to unzip the ttp-checker executable. If you are using a MacOS system unzip the MacOS checker, otherwise if you are using a Linux system unzip the Linux checker. Run the following command:


```
unzip ttp-checker.zip; chmod +x ttp-checker
```


- To check your output for testX.ttp run:


```
./ttp-checker testX.ttp testX.myout
```



- To evaluate all the public tests locally on your PC, run:


```
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```




- Most common assessment results for each test:


  - _Accepted_ : The result of the program is as expected.


  - _Wrong Answer_ : The result of the program is different from what was expected.


  - _Presentation Error_ : Program result differs from expected in blank spaces or blank lines.


  - _Compile Time Error_ : A compilation error occurred while compiling the program.


  - _Time Limit Exceeded_ : The program program execution time has exceeded the allowed time.


  - _Memory Limit Exceeded_ : Program execution memory exceeded the allowed memory.


  - _Output Limit Exceeded_ : The program execution output exceeded the allowed space.


  - Others : An error occurred during the execution of the program which caused the program to stop unexpectedly.
